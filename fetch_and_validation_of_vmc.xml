<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>Brands Indicators or logos help people visually recognize products and services,
and consequently their providers.  In the context of email, it can help users
understand who a sender is.  Brand Indicators for Message Identification is a
specification as described in <xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref> for senders to
associate and provide brand Indicators to email.  As noted in that document's
security considerations, the potential for abuse with brand indicators is high,
and in particular a risk for look-alike domains and copycat indicators.  One way
to mitigate abuse is to validate brand ownership of some Indicators by some
third-party and have that validation provably demonstrated through an X.509/PKIX
<xref target="RFC5280"></xref> certificate as an evidence document <xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref>.  We
call such certificates containing Indicators that meet the profile described
later in this document Verified Mark Certificate (VMC).  This document provides
a specification on how email receivers working on behalf of email users can
fetch VMC from the Internet and how they can validate the content of the VMC.
With this, the email receiver can prove that the VMC was indeed issued by some
trusted third-party such as a Certification Authority (CA).</t>
</section>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>BIMI: Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) specification
<xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref> that combines DMARC-based message authentication with
cryptographic methods to ensure the identity of a sender.</t>
<t>BIMI Evidence Document: A document published by a Mark Verifying Authority (MVA)
which in the context of a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) is a Certification
Authority (CA) to assert evidence of verification.</t>
<t>Email Receivers: The entity or organization that receives and processes email.
Mail Receivers operate one or more Internet facing Mail Transport Agents (MTAs).</t>
<t>End entity certificate: A non-CA certificate representing a user (or domain) of
the PKI certificates.</t>
<t>Indicator: A brand indicator displayed on a Mail User Agent (MUA e.g., an email
client) when the sender's email meets the BIMI specification requirements.  The
brand logo and other associated identity information is parsed from the Verified
Mark Certificate.  Immediate issuing CA certificate: A non-root CA certificate
that issues end entity certificates.</t>
<t>Root certificate: A self-signed CA certificate issued by the root CA to identify
itself and to facilitate verification of certificates issued by Subordinate CAs.</t>
<t>Verified Mark Certificate (VMC): An end entity certificate that meets the
profile specified in this document and the Verified Mark Certificate Guideline
document.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fetch-of-verified-mark-certificate"><name>Fetch of Verified Mark Certificate</name>
<t>This section normatively describes the actions needed to receive and handle BIMI
identified messages using Verified Mark Certificates that is built on the
protocol described in the <xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref>.  Receivers use these
specified processes to fetch Verified Mark Certificates securely, and then to
validate the certificates and their embedded Indicators.  If all requirements
are met, receivers may then display the Indicators.  Details of these steps are
described below, and the indicator display procedure is described here.</t>

<section anchor="bimi-assertion-record"><name>BIMI Assertion Record</name>
<t>The sender declares associating BIMI to a domain via an Assertion record as
normatively described by <xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref>.  That record describes the
BIMI policy and that policy may include a means to find the BIMI Indicator via
the publication of evidence documents.  The email receiver uses <xref target="RFC1035"></xref> to look
for the publication of the Assertion record as well as the lack of publication
when <xref target="RFC1035"></xref> returns NXDOMAIN.  Assertion records containing the &quot;a=&quot; tag and
associated populated value indicates that a sender has published a BIMI evidence
document for use with that domain such a Verified Mark Certificate.  The
evidence document may be found at a hosting service specified by the URI in the
value.  The rest of this document describes the process for fetching and
validating the Verified Mark Certificate with the clarification that other types
of evidence document will have their own specification for fetch and validation.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="verified-mark-certificate-fetch"><name>Verified Mark Certificate Fetch</name>
<t>Verified Mark Certificates, in this specification, are published by the sender's
web hosting service.  The service MUST use HTTPS protocol and SHOULD use TLS
version v1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> or newer to avoid protocol security bugs with earlier
versions of TLS.  That secure TLS connection MUST be established by using the
protocol specified in <xref target="RFC8446"></xref>.  The TLS certificate MUST have a valid issuance
path to some client trusted server root CA certificate using the procedures in
<xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fetch-format"><name>Fetch Format</name>
<t>Certificates fetched from the hosting service MUST be in PEM encoding
<xref target="RFC7468"></xref>.  To facilitate X.509/PKIX certificate issuance validation, the full
issuance chain up to and optionally including the root CA certificate, MUST be
present.  The downloaded file SHOULD be ordered by starting with the Verified
Mark Certificate, followed by its issuer CA certificate and potential successive
issuers all the way to the optional root CA certificate.  If the certificates
appear out of issuance order, contain duplicates or more than one VMC, the
receiver may choose to reject the validation.  The filename specified of the
BIMI Assertion record &quot;a=&quot; tag URI SHOULD have a &quot;.pem&quot; file name extension.
Email receivers MAY cache the certificates and other evidence documents, and if
so the receivers SHOULD set a Time-To-Live (TTL) on the cache entries as well as
index by URI.  This document intentionally does not specify what that TTL value
is.  If the sender wants force a certificate update, the sender MAY change the
URI to a new unique location that will &quot;bust the cache&quot;.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="verified-mark-certificate-profile"><name>Verified Mark Certificate Profile</name>
<t>The profile describes the metadata contained within the Verified Mark
Certificate.  This section normatively describes a subset of the Verified Mark
Certificate profile that pertains to the certificate issuance and validity
verification.  The remaining content of the VMC profile is defined via guidance
documents from the Authindicators (aka BIMI) Working Group, and in particular
the process for obtaining that content (with some overlap).  For example, while
this section defines a requirement for the VMC to contain the Logotype
extension, the Authindicators' VMC Guidelines document defines the content of
the logotype extension.  The following section describes the VMC profile checks
using the profile described here as part of the VMC validation process.</t>

<section anchor="logotype-extension"><name>Logotype Extension</name>
<t>Verified Mark Certificates MUST use logotype extension to carry the Indicators
in the certificate as specified in <xref target="RFC3709"></xref>.  That RFC uses secure URIs to
specify the Indicators, and this specification calls for the Indicators to be
embedded directly in the certificate via a DATA URI as defined by <xref target="RFC6170"></xref>
and <xref target="RFC2397"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="svg-indicators"><name>SVG Indicators</name>
<t>The Indicators image format MUST be SVG (an open W3C specification) as this
helps with supporting different display resolutions that likely change in the
future as SVG is a vectorized (meaning dimensionless) format.  We believe that
constraining the Indicators to a single image type will help with
interoperability.  This SVG MUST use the secure profile as defined by
<xref target="RFC6170"></xref>.  Non-normatively, to reiterate the secure profile defined there, it
is summarized as:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Use SVG Tiny profile</li>
<li>No script</li>
<li>No external resource references</li>
</ul>
<t>Additionally this document normatively specifies additional security
restrictions on the SVG formatting as defined in
<xref target="I-D.svg-tiny-ps-abrotman"></xref>.  The SVG MUST be compressed to be space
efficient, and base64 encoded for the DATA URI encoding as defined by <xref target="RFC6170"></xref>
and <xref target="RFC2397"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="bimi-domain"><name>BIMI Domain</name>
<t>A Verified Mark Certificate MUST define one or more Subject Alternative Name
(SAN) extension dNSName domain as defined by <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> that identifies the
location of the BIMI Assertion record that was used to fetch the VMC.  There may
be stronger properties that can be said about the relationship between the VMC
and the Assertion record depending on the validation done on dNSName, but that
is outside the scope of this document.  The domain name may either be the author
or organizational name as defined in <xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref> i.e. the
Assertion record domain without the BIMI header selector or &quot;default&quot; selector
and without the &quot;_bimi&quot; well-known label, meaning that it matches against any
BIMI header selector including &quot;default&quot;.  Alternatively the domain name may
specify also the BIMI header selector or &quot;default&quot; selector along with the
&quot;_bimi&quot; well-known label, and will only match against that specific selector.
If the domain is internationalized, it MUST follow canonicalization procedure
specified in section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="bimi-extended-key-usage"><name>BIMI Extended Key Usage</name>
<t>This document describes a new <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> Extended Key Usage OID that identifies
Verified Mark Certificate as id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification.
Certificates conforming to the Verified Mark Certificate profile is
distinguished by using this extended key usage.</t>

<sourcecode type="go">id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-kp 31 } OID.
</sourcecode>
<t>Verified Mark Certificates MUST contain an Extended Key Usage extension with the
id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification OID.  Also the CA certificate
representing the immediate issuer of Verified Mark Certificates MUST also
contain an Extended Key Usage extension with the
id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification OID designating its usage.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="validity"><name>Validity</name>
<t>A Verified Mark Certificate MUST specify a certificate validity period using the
notBefore and notAfter fields.  It MUST also define a location to check for
certificate revocation using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Distribution
Point and that is encoded in the VMC as a [RFC5280] cRLDistributionPoints
extension.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="certificate-transparency"><name>Certificate Transparency</name>
<t>CT as specified provides transparency for the issued certificates.  The Verified
Mark Certificate MUST be logged to a set of Certificate Transparency (CT) logs,
and the proof of that logging must be present in the certificate as a
<xref target="RFC6962"></xref> SCT extension.  The SCT extension MUST contain one or more SCTs.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="validation-of-verified-mark-certificate"><name>Validation of Verified Mark Certificate</name>
<t>Verified Mark Certificates provide the means to securely authenticate as well as
identify the third-party Mark Verifying Authority which in this case is a
Certification Authority by verifying the issuance chain.  It also provides the
means to associate the Verified Mark Certificate to the BIMI Assertion record.
This section concludes with a BIMI validation procedure for determining whether
the VMC is valid or not.  This should be used as part of a procedure in
determining whether to display a BIMI Indicator based on a VMC.</t>

<section anchor="issuance-and-profile-verification"><name>Issuance and Profile Verification</name>
<t>To ensure the correctness of that certificate information, the receiver verifies
the authenticity of the certificate, its validity and that it is a Verified Mark
Certificate.  After the certificate is downloaded, the receiver MUST validate
the certificate with the following procedure:</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>Validate the authenticity of the certificate by checking the certificate
signatures, that the end-entity certificate issuance chain leads back to some
BIMI root CA certificate, and confirm membership of the root CA certificate
in the receiver's trusted BIMI root set following the path validation
procedures specified in section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.  The downloaded
certificates MUST contain all intermediate CA certificates up to but not
necessarily including the root certificates.</li>
<li>Check the validity of the certificates in the certificate chain using the
procedures in section 4.1.2.5 of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.</li>
<li>Check that the certificates in the certificate chain are not revoked using
the procedures in section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.  The end-entity certificate MUST
identify the CRL by a cRLDistributionPoints extension.</li>
<li>Validate the proof of CT logging.  The receiver MUST find one or more SCTs,
and validate that they are signed by a CT log recognized by the receiver
using the procedures in <xref target="RFC6962"></xref>.</li>
<li>Verify that the end-entity certificate is a Verified Mark Certificate.  The
certificate MUST contain an Extended-Key-Usage extension, and that it
contains extended-key-usage is id-kp-BrandIndicatorforMessageIdentification.
The entity certificate must contain a logotype extension, and that it
contains a SVG as described in [#svg_indicators].</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section anchor="vmc-domain-verification"><name>VMC Domain Verification</name>
<t>Next the receiver checks VMC SAN dNSName domain name relationship to the
Assertion Record domain name, to demonstrate that they mutually identify each
other.  The following procedure allows the dNSName to either specify and thus
match against the Assertion Record's domain name only, or selector + domain
name.  To do this, the receiver creates two domain name sets: 1) selector-set
and 2) domain-set.  The receiver iterates over the VMC SAN dNSName domain names
and adds them to the domain name sets as follows.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If the domain name contains &quot;_bimi&quot; i.e. prefixed with the labels
&lt;selector&gt;._bimi, add to selector-set.</li>
<li>Otherwise add the domain name to domain-set.</li>
</ul>
<t>Then check if the Assertion record domain matches by checking the following:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Check if the Assertion record author or organizational domain names as defined
in [draft-blank-ietf-bimi-01], which includes the &lt;selector&gt;._bimi prefix, is
present in the selector-set.  If found, the VMC Domain Verification is
considered to match.</li>
<li>Check if the remaining Assertion record author or organizational domain name
is present in the domain-set.  If found, the VMC Domain Verification is
considered to match.</li>
</ul>
<t>If internationalization is present, the receiver MUST canonicalize the domain
names using the internationalization procedures specified in section 7.2 of
<xref target="RFC5280"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="validation-of-vmc-evidence-document"><name>Validation of VMC Evidence Document</name>
<t>The following procedure combines the above steps to determine whether a VMC
contains a valid BIMI Evidence Document.  This should be a part of a larger
receiver defined procedure to determine whether to display a BIMI Indicator that
may take into account other receiver specific signals such as reputation.</t>
<t>As a preamble, consider if the receiver supports VMC validation and an Assertion
Record is found which has BIMI VMC location in the &quot;a=&quot; tag value.  If so then
validate the VMC using the following algorithm:</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>Use the mechanism in the &quot;a=&quot; tag location to retrieve the VMC, this MUST be a
URI with HTTPS transport.</li>
<li>If the TLS connection setup as described in
[#verified_mark_certificate_fetch] fails, then validation returns with an
error.</li>
<li>If the evidence document does not contain a single valid VMC certificate
chain then validation returns with an error.</li>
<li>Validate the VMC path validation procedure described in
[#issuance_and_profile_verification]. If path validation fails then
validation returns with an error.</li>
<li>Validate the VMC Domain relationship to the Assertion record as described in
[#VMC_domain_verification] i.e. matches.  If the VMC Domain is not related to
the Assertion record, then validation returns with an error.</li>
<li>Retrieve the SVG Indicator from the [Logotype] Extension (oid
1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.12) of the validated VMC.</li>
<li>Optionally, the receiver MAY choose to retrieve the SVG Indicator from the
URI specified in the l= tag location of the Assertion Record and compare this
to the SVG Indicator embedded within the VMC. The receiver MAY fail
validation if these Indicators differ.</li>
<li>Validate the certificate meets the remaining profile specification of the VMC
as described in [#verified_mark_certificate_profile], otherwise validation
returns with an error.</li>
<li>Proceed to the Indicator Validation as described in section 8.6 in
<xref target="I-D.blank-ietf-bimi"></xref>.</li>
